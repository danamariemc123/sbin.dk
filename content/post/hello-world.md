I took time this week-end to set up [Jekyll][] to blog like an hacker :) I tried [Octopress][] on [Heroku][]. It works good but it's "less" flexible than the original one. It was a good way to use [Ruby][] again.

It's a very simple template but I will improved and work on it when I'll get time. I think it's good enough for the moment anyway. This blog will be especially a developer blog with a lot of codes hopefully. Don't hesitate to send me pull requests (PR) to correct and/or to improve posts. They are of course welcome.

<pre><code class="language-php">echo "Hello world!";
</code></pre>

You can find the entire source code of [sbin.dk][] in [Github][]. A lot of improvements will come later like [Twitter][] feed, better standards with [Media Queries][], [Microdata][], [WAI-ARIA][] and [CORS]... Maybe a bit with the responsive design too. And... I'm very excited to blog again!
